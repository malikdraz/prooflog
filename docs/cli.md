# CLI Behavior

This page describes the current public command surface.

## Implemented Now

The `prooflog` binary exists and exposes these top-level commands:

```bash
prooflog init
prooflog doctor
prooflog ingest --codex
prooflog proof --since main
```

`prooflog init` creates a local TOML config file.

`prooflog doctor` reads the config file and prints resolved paths.

The current config stores:

- database path
- Codex root
- redaction defaults

`prooflog ingest --codex` and `prooflog proof --since main` are still explicit placeholders. They do not create databases, read Codex history, inspect git state, or perform network access.

## Local Paths

When `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` are set, ProofLog uses:

```text
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/prooflog/config.toml
$XDG_DATA_HOME/prooflog/prooflog.db
```

When those variables are not set, ProofLog falls back to:

```text
$HOME/.config/prooflog/config.toml
$HOME/.local/share/prooflog/prooflog.db
```

The default Codex root is:

```text
$HOME/.codex
```

## Planned Behavior

`prooflog init` will later create local storage in addition to config.

`prooflog doctor` will later check database health, Codex history, SQLite capabilities, permissions, and git context.

`prooflog ingest --codex` will discover and ingest local Codex JSONL history.

`prooflog proof --since main` will produce the core proof report.

## Current Argument Contract

`prooflog proof` requires `--since <REF>`.

`prooflog ingest` requires `--codex`.

`prooflog init` and `prooflog doctor` support `--db <PATH>` and `--codex-root <PATH>` overrides.

These contracts are covered by integration tests so future implementations keep the initial UX stable.
